00:07.2 Hi.
00:09.1 My name is Taekjip Ha.
00:11.0 I'm a professor of biophysics and biomedical engineering
00:13.2 at Johns Hopkins University.
00:16.1 I am also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
00:21.3 Today, I'm going to tell you
00:23.2 how single molecule measurement technologies
00:26.1 are changing the way we study
00:28.2 and understand nature's nano-machines.
00:34.2 You may have heard people say that
00:36.2 proteins can be viewed as nano-machines.
00:40.0 Why?
00:41.2 First, because they are unimaginably small.
00:45.2 They are only a few nanometers across.
00:48.1 How small is a nanometer?
00:50.1 Well, the smallest object that human eyes can see
00:54.2 is about 80 [micrometers] across,
00:58.0 which is a human hair.
01:00.0 That means that you can put 20,000 proteins
01:03.2 across a single human hair.
01:05.2 So, it's really, really small and you need special technologies to be able to
01:10.0 view and measure them.
01:12.2 Proteins are also called nano-machines
01:14.2 because they can perform jobs
01:17.1 that human-made machines can do.
01:19.2 For example, they can convert chemical energy
01:22.0 into mechanical energy
01:24.1 to power proteins along DNA or other molecules,
01:30.2 or you can store energy into a protein
01:33.1 just like you can wind up a wind-up toy
01:36.1 to store mechanical energy.
01:41.3 Here is an example:
01:44.2 a virus can package its genomic material,
01:47.2 the DNA,
01:49.1 into a very small volume using
01:51.2 a protein nano-machine
01:54.1 called DNA packaging motor,
01:56.0 and this packaging motor can use the energy coming from ATP consumption
02:00.1 to move the DNA into the capsid
02:03.3 one base pair at a time,
02:06.1 and it can do this until it can build
02:10.1 a pressure that matches the pressure
02:12.2 inside a champagne bottle.
02:15.3 So it's an amazing machine that can,
02:17.2 you know,
02:19.2 cram a large piece of DNA into a very, very small volume.
02:24.0 Here's another example of a nano-machine.
02:26.1 This is a protein called kinesin
02:29.1 carrying a cargo inside a living cell,
02:32.1 and kinesin is one of the molecular motors
02:34.3 that can move on the cellular highways directionally,
02:39.3 using the energy coming from ATP.
02:43.2 Just like cars are moving on the highway
02:46.0 using gasoline as a fuel,
02:48.1 these molecules can move on microtubules
02:51.3 using ATP as the fuel.
02:58.2 So, we wanted to study the mechanism
03:02.2 of the movement of these motor proteins.
03:05.2 One way of achieving this is to
03:08.1 label the motor
03:11.0 using a single fluorescent molecule
03:13.2 and measure the movement of a motor protein
03:16.0 at the single molecule level
03:17.2 using a microscope in a dark room,
03:20.0 as shown here.
03:22.3 The labeling can be done by
03:25.1 attaching a small fluorescent molecule
03:28.1 to the site of your interest.
03:30.1 In this case, let's say a molecular motor
03:33.1 called myosin V
03:34.3 is moving on the actin filament,
03:36.2 and it's known that the center of mass of the motor
03:40.1 moves on the track
03:42.1 with a step size of 37 nanometers.
03:45.1 Here, you can put a fluorescent molecule
03:48.0 on the foot of the motor
03:50.1 and you can image that single molecule
03:52.1 as a function of time in a dark room
03:54.3 using a microscope,
03:56.2 a very sensitive microscope
03:59.1 using CCD-based detection.
04:02.2 Now, if you image a single molecule
04:07.0 using your camera,
04:08.2 you get a pixelated image shown on the left,
04:13.0 and here the pixel size is about 80 nanometers,
04:16.1 but the motor protein itself is
04:19.3 much, much smaller than even a single pixel size,
04:23.1 about 10 times smaller,
04:27.0 but because of a process called light diffraction
04:29.1 #NAME?
04:31.2 based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle --
04:34.2 when you take an image of a single molecule,
04:37.1 you know, using even the best optical microscope,
04:40.2 this molecule appears to be much bigger,
04:42.3 about 250 nanometers across,
04:45.1 which is about the half of the wavelengths of the light
04:50.0 used to image the molecule.
04:51.2 However, if you have a good enough
04:54.0 signal-to-noise ratio in your imaging,
04:56.1 then you can fit this pixelated image
05:00.2 using a 2-dimensional Gaussian function
05:03.0 and then find the center
05:05.0 with a much better precision
05:07.0 than the width of the image itself.
05:10.1 In fact, mathematics tell you that
05:13.3 you can do it down to about 1 nanometer precision,
05:16.2 and in practice it has been shown that,
05:20.1 yes, you can even approach that level
05:22.1 by, you know, going down to
05:24.1 about 1.5 nanometer precision.
05:26.0 So, it's amazing that you
05:28.0 can actually follow the movements of these motor proteins
05:30.0 in the lab,
05:33.3 down to single nanometer precision.
05:40.0 So, here's an example
05:42.1 where we imaged a single myosin V motor protein
05:45.2 moving on the track
05:47.3 and, as you can see,
05:53.1 as time goes on,
05:56.1 this spot, coming from a single molecule,
05:58.2 moves diagonally across to the top left,
06:01.2 and you can visualize individual stepping motions
06:05.1 as discrete movements,
06:07.1 you can find the center,
06:09.1 and then plot that position as a function of time,
06:13.0 and you can see beautiful steps,
06:14.2 and the step size turns out to be 74 nanometers,
06:18.1 which is twice the step size of the center of mass.
06:21.3 And this actually showed, conclusively,
06:24.1 for the first time,
06:25.2 that the step size of...
06:27.2 actually, that the molecule,
06:29.2 instead of crawling on the track,
06:31.3 it walks like a human walker, a bipedal walker,
06:34.2 and it proved a model called the hand-over-hand model
06:38.1 in the most definitive way.
06:42.1 So, to recap what I just told you,
06:44.1 what we did with the myosin V molecule
06:46.3 was just this:
06:49.0 you know, if you want to follow the movement
06:51.1 of your favorite soccer player on the field,
06:53.0 you can put a fluorescent molecule
06:56.0 on a body part of the player
07:00.0 and then follow its movements as a function of time.
07:07.1 But this measurement alone does not tell you why
07:10.2 -- you know, my favorite soccer player, here, Messi --
07:12.2 is such a great player, not a merely average player.
07:16.1 Soccer players, as you can imagine,
07:18.3 have to undergo multiple conformational changes...
07:22.0 actually, conformation is a jargon that
07:24.2 biophysicists use to denote the shape change of a molecule,
07:27.3 so a soccer player has to change his body shape
07:30.2 and posture,
07:32.2 you know, repeatedly
07:35.1 to perform the amazing action
07:37.3 of kicking and moving the ball.
07:39.1 And you are blind to the conformational changes
07:43.3 if you just follow one spot
07:47.1 in a body part.
07:50.1 In addition...
07:52.1 so, that's basically what you will be seeing,
07:55.0 you know, just one spot,
07:57.0 you know, nothing else.
08:00.0 So, we have, actually, another technology
08:01.2 that can be used to address this issue.
08:04.3 It's called FRET for
08:07.2 fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
08:10.0 Here, instead of just using one dye,
08:12.1 we use two dye molecules,
08:13.3 and one is called "donor", in green,
08:16.1 and the other is called the "acceptor", in red.
08:20.1 Now, when the two dyes are very far away from each other,
08:22.2 you use a laser light to excite the green molecule
08:25.3 and then you get emission from the green molecule,
08:28.1 so you get green photons from the molecule.
08:33.0 But if the acceptor moves closer to the donor,
08:37.0 then there is more and more
08:39.3 energy being transferred from the green molecule
08:41.3 to the red molecule.
08:43.1 As a result,
08:44.3 now you get photons coming from the red molecule,
08:47.2 of a red color.
08:49.3 So, by measuring the relative intensities
08:53.1 of the green and red molecules,
08:57.0 you can deduce how far they are away from each other
08:58.3 and if you know where the dyes
09:01.2 are attached to the molecule,
09:03.2 you can, for example,
09:05.2 distinguish between different conformations of a molecule.
09:08.3 Now, this technique
09:11.1 has a very strong distance dependence
09:13.2 and it can go from 100% energy transfer to 0
09:17.3 over a very few nanometer length scale change,
09:21.1 between 3-8 nanometers,
09:23.1 which is about the size of many proteins
09:25.3 and many other important biological molecules.
09:28.1 So it's the perfect technique
09:30.2 to measure the shape changes of
09:34.2 all kinds of important nano-machines inside our body.
09:39.2 Here's an example.
09:41.3 Imagine there's a protein
09:43.2 -- it's a butterfly that I'm using as an example --
09:45.3 you can put two dye molecules, green and red,
09:48.1 on two different locations,
09:50.1 so that in the closed conformation
09:53.3 energy transfer is efficient,
09:55.2 you get many red emissions,
09:57.2 whereas in the open conformation over there,
09:59.2 you get mainly green emission,
10:01.0 because the energy transfer efficiency is not high.
10:08.1 Here's another illustration
10:10.1 using the world famous using the world famous rap singer
10:13.2 Psy's Gangnam Style as an example.
10:15.2 So, he's going between different conformations,
10:17.3 The Sunglasses,
10:19.2 The Cowboy,
10:20.3 The Horseback Riding,
10:22.0 and The Finish,
10:23.1 and if you have dyes on the two hands,
10:25.2 then you can go in between intermediate distance,
10:28.2 a large distance,
10:30.0 and small distance,
10:31.3 and different, you know,
10:33.3 intensities of two different dyes
10:36.0 can be measured as a function of time.
10:39.3 Now, unlike what the cartoon suggests,
10:44.0 in a microscope you cannot see these two dye molecules
10:46.2 as two distinct spots because they are so close to each other,
10:50.0 much closer than the diffraction limit,
10:53.0 you know, 250 nanometer resolution of the microscopy
10:57.1 that we are using,
10:58.2 so they appear as a mixture of green and red,
11:02.2 in yellow, as shown here.
11:04.2 And when you move to the next conformation,
11:07.0 then it appears as green,
11:09.2 and then as red and so on,
11:12.0 so you can go back and forth between two conformations,
11:15.2 and you can read out the movement,
11:17.2 how quickly this movement occurs,
11:19.1 and how big the amplitude of the movement is
11:21.1 by just looking at the color change
11:23.2 as a function of time.
11:24.2 So, this is the idea,
11:26.2 and here's the final reaction.
11:28.2 So, if you measure intensities of green and red fluorescence
11:32.3 as a function of time, as you can see,
11:35.3 you can see beautifully anti-correlated changes
11:39.0 that report on the conformational changes
11:44.1 during the molecular dance.
11:48.1 Here are the results...
11:50.2 in addition to intramolecular conformational changes
11:53.1 that you can measure, as shown here,
11:56.0 you can use single molecule FRET
11:58.3 also to measure intermolecular changes,
12:02.1 interactions between two different molecules.
12:05.3 You can put a green dye on a protein
12:08.3 moving on the DNA lattice,
12:12.2 let's say, powered by ATP,
12:14.2 and then put the red dye at the destination end of the DNA,
12:20.1 then as time goes on,
12:21.3 as the protein approaches the red fluorescent molecule,
12:25.2 FRET increases and you'll see green signal going down
12:29.1 and red signal going up.
12:33.1 So, this is the idea behind using FRET to measure
12:36.1 movements between two molecules.
12:39.0 This animation is not the actual data,
12:41.2 it's what I prepared using a PowerPoint,
12:46.1 but our data is not that bad, it's almost as pretty.
12:49.0 So, here's an example where single molecule data
12:52.2 show that green and red intensities go up and down,
12:55.1 you know, green goes down initially, red goes up initially,
12:58.0 as shown in the cartoon.
13:00.1 The surprising observation here was that,
13:03.1 instead of falling off at the end of the DNA track,
13:06.2 when the molecule reaches the end of the DNA track,
13:09.3 it somehow reappears at the beginning of the track
13:13.3 and goes back to a low FRET value very quickly,
13:17.2 and then it then shows this gradual increase in FRET
13:22.2 and then repeats this process many, many times.
13:27.2 So, we have done a lot of different measurements
13:29.3 to understand the physical basis for this phenomenon
13:34.2 and how the molecule is able to perform
13:38.0 such acrobatic activities,
13:40.2 and also to deduce how this type of interesting,
13:46.0 you know, repetitive movements
13:48.2 can be useful for biological functions of the molecule.
13:52.3 So, after many months of research of this kind,
13:56.1 we eventually asked a magazine
14:01.2 to publish our research,
14:05.3 and after a usual back and forth
14:09.0 they eventually agreed to publish the study.
14:11.0 So... and then we asked an artist to,
14:15.1 you know, make a cover illustration
14:18.2 to suggest how, you know,
14:21.2 this enzyme may be performing the function.
14:23.2 So here's an example:
14:25.2 we proposed that this protein can sit on the DNA
14:28.2 and then reel in the single-stranded DNA
14:32.0 using the ATP-powered movement,
14:34.1 and then remove proteins bound to the DNA
14:36.3 to clear the DNA of unwanted proteins.
14:41.1 Well, we submitted this illustration to the magazine,
14:46.2 hoping that they would show it on the cover,
14:48.3 but unfortunately they just said, "No,"
14:52.1 and instead they showed a picture of a diabetic mouse,
14:55.3 and, well, that's fine...
14:59.1 you win some, but, you know, lose some,
15:02.1 so we just move on.
15:04.0 Here's another illustration that we paid an artist to create...
15:08.1 same idea, now we have a superhero,
15:10.3 my student Jeehae Park, who did the work,
15:14.0 sitting on the DNA and reeling in the DNA,
15:16.2 and removing asteroids bound to the DNA
15:19.0 using a powerful motor function.
15:21.3 Again, the magazine did not pick this cover either,
15:24.2 so I have to, you know,
15:26.2 use these images whenever I give public lectures.
15:32.3 Alright, so let me show you some real data
15:35.3 using DNA repair as an example.
15:42.2 As you know, DNA is an important genetic material
15:46.2 required to make proteins,
15:50.3 and proteins are the actual players
15:53.1 of the living cells in our body,
15:56.3 but DNA is under constant threat of damaging reagents.
16:00.2 If you smoke or if you go out to the sun in California,
16:04.2 then your DNA gets damaged
16:07.1 because of the smoke and also sunlight,
16:10.0 and DNA damage can cause
16:15.3 aging or cancer or other genetic disorders.
16:19.0 I see that I'm getting older every time I look at myself in the mirror,
16:23.2 so this is an important topic for me as well.
16:30.2 Do you know how much DNA you make in your lifetime?
16:35.1 It turns out that,
16:38.1 in your own body at this moment,
16:39.2 you have about 100 trillion cells,
16:46.0 and each cell contains about 2 meters of DNA,
16:50.0 and during your lifetime you,
16:52.3 you know, regenerate the cells
16:55.3 about 100 times on average.
16:57.1 So, if you connect all of the DNA molecules
16:59.2 that you produce back-to-back,
17:02.2 it can actually span a distance of one light year.
17:07.0 One light year is not a unit of time,
17:10.0 it's a unit of distance,
17:11.2 it's how far the light travels in one year,
17:14.2 so it's an enormous, actually, distance
17:17.1 and you have to make a lot of DNA.
17:19.3 And each cell in the body
17:22.3 can produce more than 1000 damages
17:27.2 even in a single day,
17:30.0 so unless you are able to repair the damages efficiently
17:32.1 you can inevitably accumulate
17:36.0 enough DNA damage to cause cancer.
17:38.1 You know, without proper DNA damage repair,
17:41.1 you'll actually get cancer at a much younger age.
17:47.1 So, there are several ways
17:50.0 to repair DNA damage,
17:52.1 and one is called mismatch repair,
17:54.3 another is called nucleotide excision repair.
17:57.2 Today, I'm going to tell you briefly about
18:00.0 a repair process called
18:04.1 homologous recombination.
18:08.1 Homologous recombination is
18:10.3 about as close as you can get to having sex,
18:14.3 if DNA can have sex.
18:18.0 So, there's a DNA and you have,
18:20.1 you know, DNA damage
18:22.2 causing a break in the middle of the DNA,
18:24.0 producing what's called a double-strand break.
18:28.1 Then, the cell has machineries to
18:31.3 digest one of the two strands of DNA
18:34.2 to produce single-stranded DNA,
18:38.1 and that single strand then finds a matching sequence,
18:42.2 you know, another copy of the same DNA inside the cell,
18:45.1 called homologous DNA.
18:47.0 And then once you find the matching copy
18:49.1 then you can use the information stored
18:51.2 in the other copy
18:53.2 to reproduce the original DNA without any mistakes.
18:59.2 This process requires a protein called RecA
19:04.3 to form a filament around single-stranded DNA,
19:10.1 and this is for bacterial cells,
19:13.2 and for humans we have its own counterpart
19:16.1 called RAD51.
19:19.2 Now, this RecA filament formed on a DNA sequence
19:23.0 has to find the matching sequence
19:26.1 in the sea of millions of different base pairs,
19:29.2 even in a small E. coli bacterium,
19:34.1 so, you know, this is equivalent to finding a soulmate,
19:37.1 your future husband,
19:41.2 you know, when you have millions of people
19:44.2 living in New York City, for example.
19:48.1 How do you actually achieve that?
19:50.1 More like finding a needle in a haystack.
19:56.1 One mechanism that has been proposed is called the 3D search.
20:01.0 Here, the filament is diffusing in solution
20:05.0 and then it randomly collides with the DNA
20:08.0 at random locations.
20:10.0 Unless it has a perfect match of sequence,
20:14.1 it dissociates quickly
20:17.1 and then goes to look for another sequence,
20:22.1 and this is more like dating a random person on the street
20:26.2 to find your soulmate,
20:30.1 and if you have a lot of actually
20:33.0 competing potential partners,
20:37.0 this can take a long time.
20:39.0 In this animation, I got tired,
20:40.1 so I just stopped it in the middle, so...
20:45.1 the filament found the correct target,
20:47.2 but you can imagine that if you millions of possibilities
20:50.2 it's going to take a long time.
20:54.2 Another possibility is called 1D sliding,
20:58.2 and this is equivalent to joining a book club.
21:02.1 So, instead of dating a random person on the street,
21:05.1 you join a club to meet people
21:09.0 who share a common interest,
21:10.2 and then you can date maybe 20 people within the club
21:13.2 to see whether you have a good fit,
21:16.0 and if you don't find the perfect match
21:19.2 then you can join a different club,
21:21.3 like a knitting club,
21:23.2 and then do the sampling again.
21:26.0 So, here's an illustration:
21:29.2 the single-stranded filament can bind
21:33.2 and then slide on the DNA, 1D sliding,
21:35.1 to sample, you know, 200 or 300 base pairs
21:38.0 before falling off,
21:39.2 so you can actually sample multiple potential partners
21:42.2 in one binding event,
21:44.1 and this can make the process much, much faster.
21:51.2 So, we perform single-molecule FRET measurements
21:55.0 of the process
21:57.2 by putting a green dye on the filament itself,
22:02.2 and the red dye on the DNA.
22:07.0 In this experiment,
22:10.1 DNA, target DNA,
22:12.0 actually does not have the matching sequence,
22:13.2 so the filament will still bind to the DNA
22:17.3 and then show sliding motion,
22:20.3 and that sliding motion,
22:22.3 if it indeed occurs,
22:25.1 then it will be visualized as fluctuations in,
22:29.1 you know, single-molecule FRET,
22:32.0 where green and red intensities go up and down
22:35.0 in an anti-correlated manner, very rapidly.
22:38.0 And this is the actual signal that we see
22:40.1 from single molecules,
22:41.3 indeed showing that RecA filament
22:46.3 can slide on the DNA,
22:49.0 possibly in search of a target sequence.
22:52.0 So that was really, really exciting,
22:54.1 but does it really
22:59.2 find the matching sequence while sliding?
23:04.0 So, we performed another experiment, shown here.
23:10.1 So, we designed a DNA sequence
23:12.1 that contains a matching sequence
23:14.1 for the filament DNA,
23:20.1 but the sequence is not very long,
23:23.3 it's only seven base pairs long,
23:25.3 so it's not a perfect match,
23:28.2 so it's as if, you know, you...
23:31.2 you find a near match,
23:34.2 but here in this case we put
23:36.3 two copies of the same near match.
23:39.2 So, you know, again,
23:42.1 to use that example of dating,
23:44.2 you may be dating twin brothers, okay?
23:48.0 Well, both are near matches,
23:50.2 but you spend some time with one of the two twin brothers,
23:53.3 but the match is not perfect,
23:56.0 so you slide off to the other twin brother,
24:00.2 and that's why you see
24:03.0 a change in FRET efficiency,
24:04.2 shown on the top,
24:06.0 and then you then leave the other brother
24:08.1 and you go back to the original brother
24:10.1 and so on.
24:11.1 So, this data showed
24:14.0 very clearly
24:16.1 that the sliding on the same DNA
24:18.2 can be used to sample
24:24.0 different sequences in search of
24:26.3 a matching sequence.
24:28.3 So, overall, data of this type
24:31.2 showed us that 1D sliding
24:34.2 can make the target search process,
24:37.0 you know, 250 times faster than 3D search,
24:41.2 and in principle this sliding activity
24:46.0 that we discovered in this study,
24:47.2 you know, can make DNA repair
24:50.3 that much faster.
24:53.1 Okay, so I have told you about how
24:55.3 single molecule fluorescence imaging,
24:57.1 tracking of single fluorescent molecules
24:59.2 and measuring the interaction between
25:02.2 two different molecules
25:04.2 to, you know, to measure
25:07.0 the activities of single protein molecules
25:11.2 in real time.
25:13.3 There is another technology
25:16.3 that is extremely popular in the single molecule biophysics community.
25:19.2 It is called the optical trap
25:22.0 or optical tweezers technology.
25:24.0 If you want, this can be viewed as
25:26.0 chopsticks made of light.
25:28.1 So, you can use a tightly focused laser light
25:33.2 to grab a single particle in solution
25:40.3 and then if you move the laser beam around back and forth
25:44.0 you can move the particle,
25:46.1 and if the other end of the DNA
25:48.2 linking the particle to the surface
25:51.1 is an enzyme that is transcribing the DNA
25:54.2 -- RNA polymerase --
25:56.2 then the distance between the particle and the enzyme
26:01.1 will change, it will become shorter and shorter,
26:03.2 and you can measure this with Angstrom-level precision,
26:07.2 and you can apply forces that are relevant
26:11.0 to physiological conditions
26:13.1 and measure the mechanical response very precisely.
26:16.2 So, my laboratory and many others
26:22.1 have decided to combine these two different technologies,
26:26.3 single-molecule FRET and the optical trap,
26:29.3 so that you can use fluorescence
26:32.1 to measure conformational changes of a single molecule,
26:35.2 but use the optical trap to apply
26:38.2 a defined level of force
26:40.3 and understand how the tension, or force applied,
26:44.1 can change the activities of a single molecule.
26:51.1 And this is equivalent to
26:55.1 combining two different features of these measurements:
26:58.2 in the optical trap measurements,
27:00.2 you are using your hands to
27:03.2 manipulate a single molecule
27:05.2 and measure its response mechanically,
27:08.0 but with your eyes closed;
27:10.2 but in the FRET measurement,
27:13.2 you are using your eyes to make observations,
27:16.1 passive observations,
27:18.1 with your hands tied in the back.
27:20.3 By combining the two,
27:23.1 we can actually hope to sample
27:25.1 the best of both worlds
27:27.1 and this is going to be the topic of my second talk.
27:34.1 Alright, so I'd like to acknowledge
27:37.2 my former and present colleagues
27:40.1 and collaborators.
27:41.2 We collaborated with Yale Goldman's lab
27:43.2 and Paul Selvin's lab
27:45.1 on the myosin V studies.
27:47.1 And Kaushik Ragunathan, Chen Liu,
27:50.1 and Chirlmin Joo, and Jeehae Park,
27:53.0 and Sua Myong
27:54.3 worked on many of the
27:59.0 single molecule FRET studies I told you about.
28:00.1 And Ahmet Yildiz and Sean McKinney
28:03.1 worked on the
28:06.3 tracking of a myosin V molecule.
28:10.3 Thank you very much.
